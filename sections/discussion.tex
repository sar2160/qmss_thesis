\subsubsection{Bias}

One goal of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of spatiotemporal prediction and forecasting using model frameworks that are relatively easy to use "out of the box". As such, models ideally should not require additional data gathering, judgment about variable inclusion, and a minimal amount of parameter tuning. In this context operating complexity was kept to a minimum by limiting input data entirely to counts and location for the variable of interest.  One obvious side effect of this choice that neverless bears stating directly is that

Potential for scalability.
